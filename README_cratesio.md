graphANNIS
==========

This is a new backend implementation of the ANNIS linguistic search and visualization system (http://github.com/korpling/ANNIS/). 

While there are test cases, this project is still in a pre-release beta phase. 
**Only a sub-set of the ANNIS Query Langugage (AQL) is supported yet (full support is planned).**
Integration with ANNIS is currently implemented in a special branch: https://github.com/thomaskrause/ANNIS/tree/feature/graphannis
